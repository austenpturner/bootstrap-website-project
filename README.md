## Changes I made while following along:

* Only using one H1 on the page, and switching to H2 or H3 for sections following the intro
* Moving some of the suggested inline styles to scss files instead as to not use a mixture of inline and imported styles

## Changes I made after following along:

## Changes I would make if I continued working on this project:

## What I learned:
* How to customize Bootstrap variables and styles
* How to use Emmet to write HTML quicker
* How to write a script in package.json to compile sass in a specified folder and file:
`
  "scripts": {
    "compile:sass": "sass --watch scss:assets/css"
  }
`
* Practice reading documentation (Boostrap, Font Awesome, GLightbox)
* Existance of helpful resources: [Get Waves](https://getwaves.io/), [Tabler Icons](https://tablericons.com/), [Many Pixels](https://www.manypixels.co/gallery), [GLightbox](https://biati-digital.github.io/glightbox/)

## Why this project?

I've been following along with FreeCodeCamp's [Front End Developer Learning Path](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbmMuZ3saqRIBimAKIMYkt0E) video series on YouTube. They are mostly refreshers for me, so I've been going out of order and alternating "easier" and "more difficult" videos. The last one I completed was the 14hr React tutorial. I'm going to skip Tailwind, as I'm feeling very comfortable with Bootstrap and trust I could learn Tailwind from reading the documentation. Next up - Testing!
